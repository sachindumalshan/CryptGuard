<h2>CryptGuard - Text Encryption and Decryption Tool</h2>

![cryptguardgui](https://github.com/sachindumalshan/CryptGuard/assets/73152414/e5569ae6-adf5-4feb-a285-783184f0cbf4)<br/>
CryptGuard is a text encryption and decryption tool developed using the Python programming language and featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) created with the Tkinter library.

**ðŸ’» Key Features:**
- Utilizes the Caesar Cipher algorithm for text encryption and decryption.
- Provides a straightforward and user-friendly environment.
- Consists of two primary sections: "Encryption" and "Decryption."

**ðŸ”’ Encryption Section:**
- Users input the text they want to encrypt.
- After clicking the "Encrypt" button, the tool generates the encrypted text and a corresponding encryption code.

**ðŸ”“ Decryption Section:**
- Users input the text they want to decrypt and the associated decryption code.
- Clicking the "Decrypt" button reveals the original text.

This tool simplifies the process of securing messages by making use of the reliable Caesar Cipher algorithm while offering an accessible interface through Python and Tkinter.<br>

<h4><u>Steps :</u></h4>
I outlined the encryption and decryption processes based on the Caesar Cipher algorithm and employed the Tkinter library in Python to craft a user-friendly graphical interface for these operations. I seamlessly integrated both components, allowing users to effortlessly encrypt and decrypt text with CryptGuard.
